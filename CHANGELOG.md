# Changelog

Notable changes to Kindlast, in the format of
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/). Versioning follows
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org), and
[`docs/versioning.md`](./docs/versioning.md) says what a breaking change means
for this product.

Entries are written rather than generated. The audience is somebody upgrading a
system that holds their compliance record, so an entry says what changed and
what they have to do about it, which no commit subject knows.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **A public readiness assessment at `/readiness`** (ENT-189). A visitor
  answers the questions a data protection officer would ask, with no account
  and no sign-up, and gets back the obligations in the Kindlast corpus that
  match their answers, each quoting the corpus entry and citing the regulation
  behind it.

  Three things a self-hoster should know about it, because they are properties
  of the deployment rather than of the page:

  - **It has no server side.** The corpus is compiled into the bundle at build
    time and the applicability rules are a pure function in the browser. There
    is no route handler, no server action and no call to `core-api`, so the
    page adds no unauthenticated surface to your deployment, needs no rate
    limit, and costs nothing per visitor beyond serving static output.
  - **It stores nothing, anywhere.** Answers live in one React state hook for
    the life of the tab. No database row, no cookie, no `localStorage`, no
    query string, and no request. A refresh loses the assessment, deliberately.
  - **Every statement of law on it is a corpus row, verbatim.** If you ship a
    modified `data/corpus/`, this page renders your text. If you ship no
    changes, it renders ours. Nothing on the page paraphrases a regulation, and
    a test fails the build if a string ever tries to.

  There is no email capture, which the issue asked for and which is held for a
  second iteration: sending the summary means putting somebody's address and
  their answers through a mail provider, and that needs a lawful basis, a
  notice, a retention position and an answer to a subject access request about
  the assessment itself, written down before the code rather than after it.

### Changed

- The local stack can run once per checkout instead of once per machine.
  `deploy/compose.yaml` still defaults to the project name `kindlast` and to
  the ports every instruction here names, so a self-hoster with one clone sees
  no change at all. What is new is that `COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME`, the
  `KINDLAST_*_PORT` variables and `KINDLAST_MODEL_DIR` now reach every part of
  the stack, including container names, so a second copy of the repository can
  bring up a second stack that shares nothing with the first.
  `scripts/stack-env.sh` derives a consistent set of those values, and
  `docs/maintainers.md` explains it. Relevant to anyone running two
  environments from one machine, and to anyone whose tooling assumed a
  container was called `kindlast-postgres-app`: it still is, unless a project
  name is set.

### Fixed

- **Intelligence refused every request for the first minute of a fresh
  deployment** (ENT-253). A newly seeded authorization server has generated no
  signing key yet and serves an empty key set, which is correct rather than
  broken: it makes the key when it issues its first token. Intelligence
  fetched that empty set at boot, treated the fetch as having filled the cache,
  and then refused the first token it was ever shown with a 401 that read as
  "signed by a key I do not know". A minute later the cooldown lapsed and
  everything worked, so this was only ever visible on a stack that was seconds
  old, which is every stack a self-hoster starts for the first time.

  The boot fetch no longer counts as the cache's one permitted refetch, so the
  first token always reaches the network for a key it does not hold. `core-api`
  already worked this way. Nothing to do on upgrade beyond taking the new
  image.

- **Intelligence exited rather than starting when it came up before the
  authorization server.** Losing that race in a compose stack is ordinary, and
  the container did not come back on its own. It now logs a warning and starts,
  and the first token fetches the keys. A genuinely misconfigured issuer still
  fails at boot with a message naming the issuer, which is the case worth
  refusing to start for.

## [0.1.0]

The version the repository has carried in its manifests since the beginning,
recorded here so the history starts somewhere rather than appearing to begin
mid-sentence. No tag was cut for it, and this file does not attempt to
reconstruct the changes that led to it: the git history is the record for
everything before the first release.
